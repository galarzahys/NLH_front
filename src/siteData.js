The sighting of the Nordic lights requires certain conditions in terms of location, climate and solar activity. We help you understand them.",
    "about_info": "On a very basic level, the phenomenon is quite simple to explain. It is created from a collision between electrically charged particles from the sun that enter the atmosphere of the earth. The lights, which are also called aurora borealis, show up at night when the sky is dark. It's like a celestial ballet of light dancing across the night sky, with a colour palette of green, blue, and sometimes even pink and violet. But even though you can't take the lights for granted it is, after all, a natural phenomenon, just like the weather – you are still guaranteed to experience magical light in Northern Norway all through the polar night. On clear days, you can see beautiful sunset colours in the south while the sky to the north is a deep midnight blue. In “the blue hour” at twilight, the snowy landscape is bathed in a glassy, deep blue colour. And even if the Auroras don't dance, experiencing the starry, limitless sky can make you reconnect with the universe...",

        "content":"The best way to see the northern lights is to head north. Most of the molecular activity that causes the northern lights happens near the Earth’s magnetic poles. For that reason, the Arctic region is an ideal location for hunting the aurora. In fact, some of the best light shows happen near or above the Arctic Circle. Between 65 and 72 degrees latitude, you'll find a region called the “northern lights belt” or “aurora zone”. It's all in the name!",

        "content":"One of the best northern lights tips you'll get is to visit during wintertime. The northern lights are visible during the northern hemisphere's winter, which is between October and March. During these months, Northern Europe experiences dark nights. Compared to summer, when the days are long, at this time of year the sun sets early. This gives you plenty of hours of darkness to chase the aurora borealis.",

Ahead of planning your trip, check for when the best weather may be in winter in the country you want to visit. Pick the driest month as a rainy cloudy sky will not be the best to see the northern lights. If you've booked your tour months ahead, you may not be able to know the daily weather in advance. But while you’re at your destination, check the weather and aurora forecasts. The one we recommend for Iceland is the MET office. You'll easily find one for each country in Northern Europe.",

        "content":"In some parts of Northern Europe, the sun sets early in the winter. This is great as it gives you longer nights to take advantage of the dark skies. However, the northern lights are most likely to appear at the darkest and coldest time of night. Peak time is between 11 PM and 2AM. Most guided tours will depart after 9 PM to give you the best chances. You may be lucky to see them earlier of course, but the best viewing are often late. Some hotels even offer a special wake-up service if the lights come out. This way you don’t have to stay up all night on the lookout.",

Book a snowmobile tour, visit the Ice or Snow Hotel, or head off on a dog sledding excursion.
